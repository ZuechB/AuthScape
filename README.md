# AuthScape

## What is AuthScape?

AuthScape (previously Authsome and NextCoreAuth) was developed to provide ease with authentication. Over the past few years I started using OpenIddict and it is great, however, I wanted to take what I have learned and provide a easy to get started template for not only myself but other developers (I hope it will be for you).

## Features included

- SQL Server Database using Code first migration
- Login and Signup page
- Custom Domain support
- Authentication sharing across subdomains
- Redirect User after login to the last page they were on
- Logout


## TO DO:

- Adding IFrame login for modal based login approach
- SSO (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and more)
- Two Factor Auth
- Passwordless
- Documentation for development, staging, and production setup
- Documentation for Azure setup
- Documentation for Self hosted (windows server)
- Optional turn off company field
- Support for Stripe, SendGrid, and Twillo giving you all the tools you need to develop without the complexity.
